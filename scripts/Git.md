Version Control and Git
=======================

Introduction
============

Motivation:

* ["FINAL".doc](http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1531)
* [A story told in file names](http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1323)
* Back-up a file only to realise later back-up was bugged or corrupted version.
* Asked for the script used to create data graphed in a conference paper.
* Asked for a figure to be redone more clearly with exactly the same code, configuration and data.
* Laptop is stolen!
* A colleague, since left, has rewritten key functionality and want to know why. 

Version control AKA revision control AKA source control records history of changes made to files or directories.

* Source code, scripts, build files, configuration files, parameter sets, data files, documentation, papers, chapters etc.
* Track Changes in Microsoft Word or file versions in DropBox or Google Drive.
* [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page).
* Changes to sets of files with reasons why.
* CVS, Subversion, Mercurial, [Git](http://git-scm.com/).
* Git is version control tool. GitHub is project hosting infrastructure that uses Git.

Tracking changes with a local repository
========================================

Create a local repository
-------------------------

Make sure you are not in any clone of the bootcamp materials!

    git
    git --version
    git help
    git help --all
    git help checkout

    mkdir cookerybook
    cd cookerybook
    git init  # Create repository
    ls .git   # Git's configuration files - DO NOT TOUCH!

Configure Git locally
---------------------

    git config --global user.name "Your Name"  # Update configuration applied to all repositories
    git config --global user.email "yourname@yourplace.org"
    cat ~/.gitconfig

    git config --global core.editor nano  # Set default editor. Alternatives are vi, xemacs,...
    git config -l                         # Alternative to cat ~/.config

Add files and directories and record changes
--------------------------------------------

Create `soup.md` in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) syntax.

Add Ingredients and Cooking Instructions but no headings.

    git status  # Current status of files in repository.

Current directory is the 'working directory'.

`Untracked` - files in working directory that Git is not managing.

    git add soup.md     # Add file to staging area (AKA index or cache or loading dock)
    git status soup.md  # Can check status to whole directory or specific files.

`Changes to be committed` - content in the staging area, ready for Git to manage.

    git commit  # Commit change to repository.

Provide a commit message, the "why":

* Git deduces what was changed and when, and, using the configuration, who by. 
* Messages like "made a change" or "commit 5" are redundant.
* Good commit messages usually have a one-line description followed by a longer explanation.

`warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF in ...`:

* Different line encoding styles across platforms.
* Git turns CRLF to LF to try and help.

Shows number of files changed, number of lines inserted or deleted across all changed files.

    git status soup.md

`nothing to commit` - Git is managing everything in the working directory.

    git log

'Commit identifier' AKA 'revision number' uniquely identifies changes made in this commit, author, date, and commit message. Can cite in papers.

    git log --relative-date

Make updates to `soup.md`.

    git status soup.md

`Changes not staged for commit` section and `modified` marker shows file managed by Git has been modified and changes are not yet committed.

    git add soup.md
    git commit

Good commits are atomic and consist of the smallest change that remains meaningful. 

Commit changes that can be reviewed by someone else in under an hour.:

* Fagan (1976) - rigorous inspection can remove 60-90% of errors before the first test is run. M.E., Fagan (1976). [Design and Code inspections to reduce errors in program development](http://www.mfagan.com/pdfs/ibmfagan.pdf). IBM Systems Journal 15 (3): pp. 182-211.
* Cohen (2006) - all the value of a code review comes within the first hour, after which reviewers can become exhausted and the issues they find become ever more trivial. J. Cohen (2006). [Best Kept Secrets of Peer Code Review](http://smartbear.com/SmartBear/media/pdfs/best-kept-secrets-of-peer-code-review.pdf). SmartBear, 2006. ISBN-10: 1599160676. ISBN-13: 978-1599160672.

<p/>

    mkdir images
    cd images

    # Get image
    wget http://www.cookuk.co.uk/images/slow-cooker-winter-vegetable-soup/smooth-soup.jpg
    # Or
    curl http://www.cookuk.co.uk/images/slow-cooker-winter-vegetable-soup/smooth-soup.jpg -o smooth-soup.jpg
    # Or use browser and manually put into directory

Add directory to repository:

    git add images
    git commit -m "Added images directory and soup image" images

<p>

    [Soup](images/smooth-soup.jpg "My soup")

<p>

    git commit -m "Added link to image of my soup." soup.md

What to commit:

* Anything that is created manually e.g. source code, scripts, Makefiles, plain-text documents, notes, LaTeX documents, configuration files, input files.
* This can include Word or Excel.

What not to commit:

* Anything created automatically e.g. object files, binaries, libraries, PDFs etc.
* These can be recreated from sources.
* Reduces risk of auto-generated files becoming out-of-synch with the sources they are created from.

View differences
----------------

Make and commit changes to `soup.md`.

    git diff soup.md

* `-` - a line was deleted. 
* `+` - a line was added. 
* A line that has been edited is shown as a removal of the old line and an addition of the updated line.

Discard changes
---------------

    git checkout -- soup.md  # Throw away local changes and 'revert'.
    git status data-report.md

Look at history
---------------

Make and commit changes to `soup.md`.

    git log
    git log soup.md
    git log --oneline
    git diff COMMITID
    git diff OLDER_COMMITID NEWER_COMMITID
    git log
    git checkout COMMITID  # Roll-back working directory to state of repository at first commit.
    ls
    cat soup.md
    git checkout master  # Return to current state.
    ls

'undo' and 'redo' for directories and files.

* Commit early, commit often and increase granularity of undo/redo.
* If you make a mistake e.g. check in buggy code, the older versions are still available.
* DropBox and GoogleDrive preserve versions, but delete old versions after 30 days, or, for GoogleDrive, 100 revisions. DropBox allows old versions to be stored for longer but you have to pay. 
* Version control is only bounded by space available.

Use tags as nicknames for commit identifiers
--------------------------------------------

    git tag BOOTCAMP  # Human-readable name for cryptic commit identifier.
    git tag

Make and commit changes to `soup.md`.

    git checkout BOOTCAMP
    git checkout master
    git diff BOOTCAMP

Tags:

* Tag when scripts or code released e.g. `VERSION.1.2` so can retrieve these versions to fix bugs.
* Tag when configuration files, scripts and code are used to generate data for a paper e.g. `JPHYSCOMP.03.14` so can redo an analysis if paper comes back from reviewers with questions, or reader can recreate analyses.
* Use easy-to-remember, meaningful, self-documenting names, as for variable, function, package, module, class, library, program and script names.

Branches
--------

    git status

* `master` is Git's default branch.
* A branch is a set of related commits made to files the repository, each of which can be used and edited and updated concurrently. 
* Create a new branch from any commit at any time. 
* When complete, merge the branch into another branch, or into `master`.

Question: why might this be useful?

Answer:

* Release code and scripts to users or other researchers. Continue developing. They find a bug. Tell them to wait till we've done our next version, release a half-complete version, release a patch or use a branch from our last release and release a bug-fixed version.
* Experiment with developing a new feature, or an optimisation, we're not sure we'll keep.
* Simultaneously prepare a paper for submission and add a new section for a future submission.

<p/>

    git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all  # Pretty-print
    alias gitpretty='git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all'
    gitpretty

    git branch           # See all branch names. * is current branch
    git branch layout    # Create branch
    git branch

    git checkout layout  # Switch to layout branch
    git branch           # Two concurrent branches now exist

Make and commit changes to the end of `soup.md` and pretty-print log.

Checkout `master`, make and commit changes to existing lines of `soup.md`  and pretty-print log.

Checkout `layout`, make and commit changes to the end of `soup.md` and pretty-print log.

Checkout `master`, make and commit changes to existing lines of `soup.md` and pretty-print log.

    git merge layout  # Merge changes from layout into master

Merging is done file-by-file, line by line. A new commit is automatically created to represent the merge.

    git log
    git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all

What happens if we edit the same lines in both branches?

Checkout `layout`, make and commit changes to `soup.md`, pretty-print log.

Checkout `master`, make and commit changes to the same lines of `soup.md`, pretty-print log.

    git merge layout

`CONFLICT` - changes can't be seamlessly merged because changes have been made to the same set of lines in the same files.

    git status

`Unmerged` - files which have conflicts.

    cat soup.md

Conflict markup:

* `<<<<<<< HEAD` - conflicting lines local commit.
* `=======` - divider between conflicting regions.
* `>>>>>>> 71d34decd32124ea809e50cfbb7da8e3e354ac26` - conflicting lines from remote commit.

Conflict resolution - edit and do one of:

* Keep the local version, which, here, is the one marked-up by `HEAD`.
* Keep the other version, which, here, is the one marked-up by the commit identifier.
* Or keep a combination of the two.

<p/>

    git add soup.md  # Explicit add and commit to resolve conflict
    git commit -m "Resolved confict in soup.md by ..."
    git log
    git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all

<p/>

    git branch -D layout  # Delete branch when no longer needed

Review using [Images of the key steps in this section](GitBranches.md)

DropBox and GoogleDrive don't support this ability. 

No work is ever lost.

Summary
-------

* Keep track of changes like a lab notebook for code and documents.
* Roll back or forward, undo and redo, changes to any point in the history of changes.
* Use branches to work on concurrent versions of the repository.

Question: what problems or challenges do we still face in managing our files?

Answer:

* Delete the repository means losing not just our current work but its history.
* How to access repository if away from our usual workstation?

Work from multiple locations with a remote repository
=====================================================

Host repository elsewhere from your local laptop or workstation:

* Site or institution-specific repositories.
* [GitHub](http://github.com) - pricing plans to host private repositories.
* [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) - free, private repositories to researchers. 
* [Launchpad](https://launchpad.net) 
* [GoogleCode](http://code.google.com)
* [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net)

Version control plus integrated tools e.g. visualise branches, browse histories, automatic e-mails with commits, syntax highlighting, visualising diffs, release management, wikis, issue trackers, user management etc.

Get an account:

* [Sign-up for free GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* [Sign-up for free BitBucket account](https://bitbucket.org/account/signup/)

Create new repository called `cookbook`:

* GitHub - check Public option is selected
* BickBucket - check private repository option is selected.
* Check Initialize this repository with a README is not selected.

Question: is publicly visible code on BitBucket or GitHub open source?

Answer: yes, but only if it has an open source licence. Otherwise, by default, it is "all rights reserved".

    git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/cookbook.git  # Repository URL alias
    git push -u origin master  # Set local repository to track remote repository

    git remote add origin https://USERNAME@bitbucket.org/USERNAME/cookbook.git  # Repository URL alias
    git push -u origin master   # Set local repository to track remote repository

Refresh web pages and look at code, commits and branch graphs.

Clone remote repository
-----------------------

    rm -rf cookerybook

    git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/cookbook.git

    git clone https://USERNAME@bitbucket.org/USERNAME/cookbook.git

    cd cookbook
    git log
    ls -A

Question: where is the `cookerybook` directory?

Answer: `cookerybook` was the directory that held our local repository but was not a part of it.

Push changes to remote repository
---------------------------------

Make and commit changes to `soup.md`.

    git push origin master

Refresh web pages and check that changes are now in the remote repository.

Collaboration
=============

Form into pairs and swap GitHub / BitBucket user names.

One of you share your repository with your partner - we'll call you the Owner:

* GitHub - Owner click on the Settings tab, click on Collaborators, and add partner's GitHub name.
* BitBucket - Owner click on the Share link, and add partner's BitBucket name.

Both Owner and partner clone the Owner's repository e.g.

    git clone https://github.com/OWNERUSERNAME/cookbook.git
  
    git clone https://USERNAME@bitbucket.org/USERNAME/cookbook.git 

Owner make, commit and push changes to `soup.md`.

Instructor clone another copy and "mock" collaboration.

Pull changes from a remote repository
-------------------------------------

Partner 'fetch' changes from remote repository:

    git fetch
    git diff master origin/master

`diff` compares current, `master` branch, with `origin/master` branch, an alias for the branch fetched from the remote, cloned, repository.

    git merge origin/master
    cat soup.md

Partner make, commit and push changes to `soup.md`.

Owner 'fetch' changes from remote repository.

Partner 'pull' changes from remote repository:

    git pull    # fetch and merge in one go
    cat soup.md
    git log

Exercise - collaborate
======================

Owner and partner alternatively pull, change, commit, push.

Owner and partner together:

* Both edit different lines of the same file, add it and commit it.
* Both push.
* Whoever doesn't get there first, pull then push.
* Both edit same lines of the same file, add it and commit it.
* Both push.
* Whoever doesn't get there first, pull, resolve conflicts, push.
* Repeat! 
* Try editing and adding new files and directories too.

Summary
-------

* Host clones of repository remotely and work from multiple locations.
* Push and pull changes between clones e.g. laptop, workstation, BitBuchet, ARCHER.
* Work solo or with others in a managed way with no risk of losing work.
* Alternative to e-mail or SFTP code back and forth.

Exercise - Copy the bootcamp material
=====================================

* Create a `bootcamp` repository on GitHub/BitBucket.
* Change into the directory you cloned at the start of the bootcamp.
* Push this repository to your remote `bootcamp` repository.
* Keep using this repository throughout the rest of the bootcamp!

Conclusion
==========

* Provenance:
 * Record complete history of changes to scripts, code, input files, configurations, parameters, reports, like a lab notebook. 
 * Record who changed what, why and when.
* Replicability and reproducibility:
 * Bind results, data and papers to scripts, code, configuration data that produced them.
* Security:
 * Backup work in multiple locations.
 * Collaborate and identify and resolve conflicts without risk of work being lost through deletion or overwriting.
* Collaboration:
 * Work on shared files with other researchers in your project.
 * Work on your own files from multiple locations.
* Experiment:
 * Experiment with refactoring, bug fixes, optimisations, rewrites using branches without cryptic naming schemes.
